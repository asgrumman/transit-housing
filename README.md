# Mapping Affordable Housing and Public Transit Access in Chicago
## Summary

I made a few maps that show how public transit and affordable housing intermingle by neighborhood in Chicago using pandas, geopandas, and bokeh in Python. I also made a tutorial, which I'll post to my website soon and link here.

## Data
- [Neighborhood Boundaries in Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Neighborhoods/bbvz-uum9)
   - shapefile for geometry of neighborhood boundaries
- [Affordable Rental Housing Developments](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Affordable-Rental-Housing-Developments/s6ha-ppgi)
   - Affordable units supported by the City of Chicago to maintain affordability in local neighborhoods
- [CTA: List of 'L' Stops](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-System-Information-List-of-L-Stops/8pix-ypme)
   - Location and basic service availability information for each place on the CTA system where a train stops
